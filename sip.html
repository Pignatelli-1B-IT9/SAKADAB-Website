	 <b style="color: #FFFADA;">In the midst of this pandemic, many people have been buying more resources in the grocery lately unlike before.
	 More items are sold out for the sake of the safety of everyone in the household, which includes food resources such
	 as vegetables in which the price is expensive and gives a hole to the wallets of our parents, especially to the 
	 SAKADAB. Before we know what the importance of the study is all about, we must learn alot on how compostable 
	 fertilizer is a good alternative to make plants grow tall faster. This value of composting to the communities 
	 and the environment is that we learn how to reuse materials that we throw alot. Instead of throwing such materials, 
	 we can reuse them for the sake of the environment. So, me and my team made an experiment on using dried banana 
	 peels and crushed eggshells on tomato seeds as an alternative to fertilizer in order to make use of the compost 
	 we get from food we eat to avoid wasting such material. In this way, we can earn food resources at an affordable 
	 price due to the materials needed being cheaper than groceries overall. The institution such as the SAKADAB can 
	 benefit from composting especially from our project by receiving the crops that we will plant through our experiment, 
	 they may also follow such art of composting if they can. This is because the people in the SAKADAB have been facing 
	 financial problems especially in this pandemic. Instead of paying thousands of pesos in groceries, they can spend 
	 less in buying gardening materials and in reusing compost as fertilizer.</b>

     Will the mixture of dried banana peels and eggshells boost the height increase rate and number of leaves of a tomato plant?</b>
	 <hr style="width:80px;"> </hr>
	 <b style="color: #FFFADA;"> Hypothesis <br><br>
	 If we use crushed eggshells and dried banana peels as a fertilizer to tomato plants,  then the height increase rate and 
	 number of leaves of the tomato plants will increase faster. </b>
	 <hr style="width:80px;"> </hr>
	 <b style="color: #FFFADA;"> Variables <br><br>
	 Controlled Variables - Location of experiment, pots used throughout experiment, type of water used, amount of water given, amount of sunlight given <br><br>
	 Independent Variable - Usage of banana peels and crushed eggshell mix as fertilizer <br><br>
	 Dependent Variables - Height increase rate of the tomato plant, number of leaves of tomato plant<br><br><br>
