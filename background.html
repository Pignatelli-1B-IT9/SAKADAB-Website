	 <b>The important data we gathered about our institution is the <span>financial instability</span> that they are facing. Financial instability is a
	 problem for the SAKADAB, in which it has forced them to <span>lack basic needs</span> such as in the medical aspect. This was caused by the pandemic,
	 as <u>less people are visiting the institution</u>, this means <span> they get less income from their asset of making handicraft</span> and due to the 
	 unstable donations of the government and the families of the people living in the community.
 <br> <br>
	  
This specific problem has been a burden to the people of SAKADAB, most notably because of the effects of the <u>COVID-19 pandemic</u>.
	 As a group, we aim to fix this problem by <span>engaging many audiences to support our project</span> <u>through our social media posts</u>. 
	 We also plan to <u>give what we can to the institution</u>, such as <span>asking our families to support our project</span> by donating funds,
	 and also give supplies that we hope can help the SAKADAB. Academically, we were tasked to do our SIP experiment on composting 
	 but due to the limitations of the SAKADAB, we planned on giving the harvested crops from our experiment to them in order to 
	  not waste the supply that we have made.
<br> <br>
The project is important for the institution because <span>the project intends to help them in their financial problem stated.</span> 
The project is also important to Ateneo students because it <u>gives them an idea</u> on what we aim to achieve as students; 
to help those who are in need and to develop good morals in relation to our Ignatian Values. Lastly, the project is 
also important for the people because it also inspires them to help, as they are also called to be the Children of God. 
In our lessons, we are taught to be liberators, and experience freedom. The people must be inspired to fulfill these in 
order to make ourselves closer to God spiritually.	  </b> </div>

<div id="background2" style="color:#FFFADA"> <a id="AbPGH"> The PGH - What is it and Reflection<br>
	  <img src="PGHlogo.png" class="bgpic" style="width:300px;">
	 <b style="color:#FFFADA">Our Project, the PGH, means to <span class="green">promote, give, and help</span>. In this project, we aim to help the SAKADAB 
	 in its pressing concern today; financial instability. The problem of financial instability plays a big 
	 challenge to the SAKADAB since it gives the community a really hard time in allocating their funds. 
	 When we mean by  having a <u>hard time allocating their funds</u>, they have to pay for many aspects of livelihood <span class="green">in sacrifice</span>
	 for many other aspects such as medical needs.  <br> <br>

	  
With the project, the SAKADAB community will be <span class="green">able to live without a burden</span> once again. 
We hope to <u>benefit the institution with our gathered donations</u> through considering their 
needs with the funds. All of these will be done through the <span class="green">help of online utilization 
of social media, and through the help of the people around us</span>. In addition, the group
that created PGH individually have roles on how to oversee the project with the addition
of our beloved volunteers. By the end of our project, we aim to get atleast a minimum 
of 10,000 pesos. Even if it may sound low economically, we still hope to gain more than
this small amount so that we can concretely and efficiently help the SAKADAB.<br> <br>

Ipapaninindigan namin ang aming gagawing tugon sa problemang nabanggit sa pamamagitan ng 
kung paano inaapektuhan ng isyung ito ang mga miyembro ng aming partner institusyon. 
Mula noong pandemiya, ang SAKADAB ay <span class="green">inaapektuhan ng maraming problema</span> at tulad rito 
ay ang <u>kakulangan ng pondo</u>. Ang problemang ito, ay nakakapekto sa mga mapagkukunan at 
mga supply na kinakailangan para sa institusyon. Sa ganitong klase na problema, alam 
natin na hindi nila mailutas ang problemang ito, kaya gumawa kami ng proyektong PGH, 
Promote, Give, Help. Sa aming proyekto, plano naming <span class="green">maimpluwensyahan ang iba sa 
pamamagitan ng social media</span> sa mga donasyon at pag-promote ng mga produkto, ang 
handicraft, ng partner na institusyon. Pinag-iisipan rin namin na <u>kami mismo at 
ang aming pamilya</u> ay tumulong sa kanila, sa pagbigay ng pondo o sa pagbigay ng 
pagkain tulad ng gulay na kinukuha namin sa SIP. Sa proyektong ito, maaaring 
matulungan namin ng lubos ang SAKADAB.
